## Chainlink
We have used chain link in a project for adding a functionality for limit order. In the limit order we use changing automation to constantly check if the userâ€™s time period to execute a limit order is active or not and whenever the chain link find an executable transaction it executes it.

### Limit Order using Chainlink Automation

This project includes contracts to deploy a chainlink automated limit order function which triggers a swap whenever user's set price is achieved.

This contract is using both UniswapV3 and UniswapV2 for the swap. 

Using Chainlink automation we have added checkUpkeep and performUpkeep. checkUpkeep contains logic to fetch and compare current price and if it matches any of the order's set price the performUpkeep is triggered. 
We are using forwarder to secure the perform function.
